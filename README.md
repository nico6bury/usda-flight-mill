# usda-flight-mill

This program is meant to take output from the Flight Mill through WinDaq. Files from WinDaq are converted to csv files, and then entered into this application to be processed. This results in a text file, which might or might not be compressed. The original program was developed by Bill Rust, but continuing development will be done by Nicholas Sixbury as of March 2023.
